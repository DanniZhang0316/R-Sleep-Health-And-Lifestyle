# Sleep Health & Lifestyle Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the **“Sleep Health and Lifestyle”** dataset to identify the key factors influencing sleep quality.  
The dataset contains **374 observations** and **13 variables**, including demographic, physiological, and lifestyle-related features :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

The objective of this study is to examine how stress, sleep duration, BMI, heart rate, and occupation relate to perceived sleep quality.

## Methods

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Computed mean, standard deviation, median, and range for numerical variables.
- Identified dominant categories for categorical variables.

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Applied **Spearman correlation** to evaluate relationships between ordinal and continuous variables.
- Focused on associations between sleep quality and:
  - Sleep duration  
  - Stress level  
  - Heart rate  
  - BMI  
  - Age  

### 3. Group-Based Analysis
- Categorized sleep duration into short, medium, and long groups.
- Categorized stress levels into low, medium, and high groups.
- Compared sleep quality distributions across:
  - Stress groups  
  - BMI categories  
  - Gender  
  - Occupations

## Key Findings

- **Sleep duration** has a very strong positive correlation with sleep quality (r = 0.89).
- **Stress level** has a very strong negative correlation with sleep quality (r = -0.91).
- Higher **heart rate** is associated with poorer sleep quality.
- Higher **BMI** and presence of sleep disorders are linked to lower sleep quality.
- High-stress occupations (e.g., doctors, sales representatives, scientists) show lower average sleep quality.
- Men report slightly different stress–sleep perception patterns compared to women.

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that **stress level and sleep duration are the two most important determinants of sleep quality**.  

To improve sleep quality, individuals should:
- Maintain stress levels below 6.5  
- Aim for approximately 7.6 hours of sleep per night  
- Maintain a healthy BMI
